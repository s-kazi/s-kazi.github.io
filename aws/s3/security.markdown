Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable and durable object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). S3 offers several security features to protect the data stored in it. Here are some of the security measures you can take to secure your data in AWS S3

### Encryption
S3 supports server-side encryption of objects using AWS-managed keys, AWS KMS (Key Management Service) customer master keys, or customer-provided encryption keys. You can also use client-side encryption to encrypt data before uploading it to S3.
